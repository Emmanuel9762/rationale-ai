# RationaleAI checkpoint handoff

Baseline: `027f5d3` (CP6B, persisted entries using IPv4 Neon HTTP).

## CP7 — reproducible migrations

The original two migrations already match the schema; no rewrite or new schema
migration was necessary. Added an isolated PostgreSQL replay test and an IPv4
migration command. See MIGRATIONS.md before running against any existing data.

## CP8 — read the journal

`/trades` lists 25 entries per page; `/trades/[id]` shows the saved trade and
rationale. Queries join accounts and users to enforce the supplied email scope.
Invalid and out-of-scope IDs do not return records. Tests cover persistence,
pagination, deterministic ordering, missing IDs and ownership boundaries.

## CP9 — correct and close trades

`/trades/[id]/edit` uses the same form and parser as creation. Exit price/time
must be supplied together; exit cannot precede entry. Open trades cannot carry
realized P&L. Decimal strings preserve database precision; dates are explicitly
UTC and reject invalid calendar dates. Failed saves retain the form contents.

The app reuses the oldest existing development account instead of inserting an
account on every save. Existing duplicate accounts and their trades are retained.
First-ever concurrent account creation can still create duplicates: a future
account/authentication checkpoint should introduce a uniqueness rule after
reconciling existing data. This remains a single-user development application.

Previous timestamps were interpreted in the server's timezone. Existing stored
values are displayed without retroactive conversion. Check old entries manually
if your original server used a non-UTC timezone. New/edit forms explicitly use UTC.

## CP10 — real dashboard metrics

The database sums decimal P&L, scoped to the development user. Only trades with
both exit fields and recorded P&L count toward realized P&L, win rate and profit
factor. Break-even entries count in the win-rate denominator. Missing P&L and
open/incomplete rows remain visible separately. Currency conversion is not
implemented; entered P&L must use one account currency. P&L is broker-entered,
not calculated from price/quantity without instrument specifications.

## Verification and local smoke check

Run `npm ci`, `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build`.
Tests use isolated PGlite databases and never connect to Neon. A build needs a
syntactically valid DATABASE_URL but does not query it during prerendering.

With your existing private `.env.local`, run `npm run dev`, then:

1. Log an open trade. Confirm its detail page and history persist after refresh.
2. Edit its notes, then close it using a later exit time and broker-recorded P&L.
3. Confirm the same trade ID remains and the dashboard totals change correctly.
4. Attempt an exit before entry; confirm a helpful error retains the form values.
5. Check existing CP6B trades are still visible and the IPv4 connection works.

No live Neon insertion, live migration history audit or browser end-to-end test
was performed in the implementation environment. No live schema changes were
made. Isolated tests do not establish live connectivity.

Before a public/multi-user release: replace the development identity with
session authentication, retain query-level ownership enforcement, reconcile
account duplicates, and add concurrency protection for simultaneous edits.
